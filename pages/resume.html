  <h1>Resume</h1>
  <h3>tl;dr</h3>
  <p>Seasoned programmer with experience building world-class apps. Lately I've been using Node.js with MongoDB and AngularJS and, of course, Objective-C for iOS apps. I have written everything from a high-performance search engine in C++ serving billions of search results, to a crazy game based on a De Stijl painter and once, even an ant colony simulator (using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercard">Hypercard</a>). I love to build stuff.</p>

  <h3>Early Experiences</h3>
  <p>Learned to push-up, sit-up, crawl, walk and talk. All self-taught.</p>
  <p>Early exposure to computers was through my father who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modular-Programming-Cobol-Business-Processing/dp/0471033251">Modular Programming in COBOL</a> in the early 70's. I got to hang out in the server room, checkout the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era">punched cards</a> and play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(text_game)">Star Trek</a> on a dial up terminal.</p>
  <p>We bought an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_family">Apple II</a> and thus began my early programming experience.</p>
  <h3>Music Education</h3>
  <p>I began playing drums early and over the years built up a pearl Slingerland drumset just like one of my idols: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Rich">Buddy Rich</a>. In 1981 I marched with the <a href="http://crossmen.org">Crossmen Drum & Bugle Corps</a> playing marimba. After that I studied with the great <a href="/pages/nora.html">Nora Davenport</a>.</p>
  <p>By 1986 I was playing vibraphone and studying Jazz. I called up the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaki_Byard">Jaki Byard</a> and I began making the 4 hour drive from my home in Pennsylvania to his house in Hollis, Queens, for lessons once a month. 
  </p>
  <h3>Early Programming</h3>
  <p>I moved to NYC in 1988 to persue a career in music. But soon the programming bug caught up with me again and I found myself spending more time in front of the computer than my instrument. By 1990 I decided to get back into programming full-time. I spent almost a year doing little else except programming, eating and sleeping. I wrote a full-fledged PC diagnostics program in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turbo_pascal">Turbo Pascal</a>. The app tested every aspect of a computer including memory and hard disks.

  <h3>Muze Inc. (1991-1998)</h3>
  <p>In 1991 I joined Muze as a programmer. At the time I was the second programmer to join the team. We wrote touch-screen kiosks for music stores based on our database of every CD in print. I helped build the music kiosk and then went on to write the backend and kiosk for our video and books systems. The first music kiosk was written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)">Clipper</a>. The video kiosk was written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">Foxpro</a>, and the books kiosk was written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visual_basic">Visual Basic</a>. I helped build up an awesome team of developers at Muze.

  <h3>Barnesandnoble.com (1998-2003)</h3>
  <p><a href="http://bn.com">bn.com</a> launched in 1997. I joined in 1998 to run the search engine. At the time I joined the entire search engine for the site was an extended stored procedure in SQL Server!! I quickly built a new engine in C and sped up response times by several orders of magnitude. I built up a small team of great developers, including Jim Korenthal of PHDBase fame, and we built a second search engine from the ground up in C++. In it's day, I believe it was one of the top site-specific search engines on the web. The search engine handled complex boolean queries and some site-specific natural language queries ("books about trains for grades 3-5", "recommended history books"). It also supported dynamic relevance sorting and was super fast.
  <br/><br/>
  At the time, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/">Jakob Nielsen</a> wrote, <i>“BN is lean and fast. It’s easy to find books here, even if you misspell the author’s name.”</i> Little did he know that I knew he'd review the site, and I knew he'd mis-type his own name to check the results so we made sure that every possible mis-spelling of Jakob and Nielsen returned his books. After I left in 2003 the search engine continued to perform flawlessly for years performing billions of searches.</p>
  <h3>Semandex (2003-2011)</h3>
  <p>After years of commuting from Princeton NJ to NYC everyday I decided to take a local job to be able to spend more time with my daughter. Semandex is a defense contractor mostly dealing with the intelligence branches. I was the principal software engineer and we built up a fantastic team of engineers led by my good friend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeffrey-mershon/2/b07/578">Jeff Mershon.</a> Most of the development was done in Java but eventaully the front-end was built using this "new" thing called AJAX. At the time we used <a href="http://developer.tibco.com/gi/default.jsp">General Interface</a> (before they were bought by Tibco). I maintained a TS/SCI security clearance and if I tell you any more, I'd have to kill you.</p>
  <h3>Fuzzi Tail (2010-present)</h3>
  <p>In 2010 my brother <a href="http://www.jonarmstrong.com">Jon Armstrong</a> and I started <a href="http://www.fuzzitail.com">FuzziTail</a> and developed <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/mondrian/id347927621?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D6">Mondrian</a>, a puzzle game based on the artwork of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian">Piet Mondrian</a>. The game was quite fun to develop and the seemingly simple puzzles turned out to be quite difficult to solve.</p>
  <p>
  <b>"A work of Art"</b><i>"...its character, art style, and terrific gameplay justify the price. Mondrain can rest in peace knowing that his iDevice game has been transformed into a 5-Dimple work of art."</i>

  <br/>
  <b>✭✭✭✭ 4 stars</b> <i>"Mondrian is a great game injecting loads of personality, and style into a genre that usually is just associated with blue blocks."</i>

  <p>My latest app is <a href="http://syde.me">Syde</a>. Syde is a fun social photo collaboration app where you take half a photo (a Syde), share it publicly, with friends, or privately, and the other person takes the other half of the photo. It's really fun, and a great way to make a connection between people. My original inspiration was the drawing game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">exquisite corpse</a> that I used to play with my family when I was a kid.
  </p>
  <h3>CueNotes.com (2012 - present)</h3>
  <p>
  I co-founded <a href="https://www.cuenotes.com">CueNotes.com</a> with my friend <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bendean">Ben Dean</a>. Both of us being musicians, we wanted to develop something of lasting value for the music world. The simple idea around CueNotes is to bring a social experience back to music in the digital age. There was no place on the web for fans, artists, and music lovers to discuss music in a engaging and useful way. CueNotes combines a social network with a concept similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Up_Video">Popup Video</a>. Artists can contribute their own CueNotes much like they used to in the liner notes of old, but interact with fans in a way that was never possible before.

  I wrote the backend in <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>, and the inital iOS app in objective-c. Our web-app is written using <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> and <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marionette</a>.

    <h3>Consulting (2013 - present)</h3>
  <p>
  My latest consulting gig is with SiriusXM where I built a web app to showcase their traffic and traffic related data. The app was written in <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> with a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> backend. I really like AngularJS. It's simple, flexible and it makes a lot of stuff soooo easy to do.
