    <h1>Need an <strong>iOS</strong> Developer?</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Jef Armstrong. I've been a developer for over 25 years. I've done everything from writing touch-screen kiosks for music/video/book stores, developing a high-performance search engine for barnesandnoble.com in C++, to writing iOS games.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:30px;">
        I've written two iOS games, a social music app, a social photo sharing app, and helped add features or bug fixes to many more.
    </p>
    <h1>Need a <strong>node.js</strong> backend?</h1>
    <p>
        I can do that too. I've written several backend server api's for mobile apps, all in node.js with MongoDB databases. I usually run them on Heroku or AWS directly. I have also written several Angular.js front-end apps for various clients.
