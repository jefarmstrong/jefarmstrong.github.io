We bought a new house in the winter of 2012. In the backyard were two sheds. Both had electrical run from the house and the one on the left had insulation. So I decided to turn it into a home office.

Here's the shed as it originally looked when we bought the house. It had power and some insulation, but the windows were single pane and couldn't open and the door was of the double barndoor variety.

I ripped out all the shelves, we framed out a new ceiling and I had some more electrical circuits and outlets installed.
